# Summary of Changes Made to Fix Portal Scraping

## Problem
The application was only scraping 6 portals (MERX, CanadaBuys, BCBid, SEAO, Biddingo, BidsAndTenders) out of the 26 configured portals.

## Solution
I've updated the code to scrape ALL 26 procurement portals across Canada.

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/main.py`

#### Updated `ProcurementScanner.__init__` method:
- Added all 26 portals to the `self.portals` dictionary
- Created instances of scraper classes: `ProvincialScrapers`, `MunicipalScrapers`, `SpecializedScrapers`, `HealthEducationScrapers`

#### Updated `scan()` method:
- Added handling for all portal types
- Provincial portals now use `ProvincialScrapers` methods
- Municipal portals now use `MunicipalScrapers` methods  
- Specialized portals now use `SpecializedScrapers` methods
- Health/Education portals now use `HealthEducationScrapers` methods
- Each portal gets proper driver management and error handling

## New Files Created

### 1. `start-docker.sh`
A startup script that:
- Checks for .env file and creates it if missing
- Verifies Docker is running
- Starts all services with docker-compose
- Waits for services to be healthy
- Provides helpful information about the application

### 2. `ALL_PORTALS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
Comprehensive documentation explaining:
- All 26 portals now being scraped
- How the implementation works
- Portal categories and coverage
- Running instructions
- Troubleshooting guide

### 3. `backend/test_scrapers_status.py`
A test script to verify which scrapers are available and properly configured.

# Frontend Setup Options

## ‚úÖ Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for Development)

**Use this option if you want to:**
- Develop and modify the frontend code
- Use hot reloading for faster development
- Debug frontend issues easily

### Quick Setup:
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./setup-frontend-local.sh
```

### Manual Setup:
1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Node.js**:
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

# Build and start frontend
docker-compose build frontend
docker-compose up frontend -d
